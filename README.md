# I am Shekhar
a JavaScript Developer, a Software Developer with UX aware mindset, and a tech entrepreneur. 

My skillset can quality me (depending on how you describe a role), a Fullstack Developer, a Frontend Developer, an Engineering Manager, or a Tech Lead.

In summary, I can take a concept, be it just an idea or a predefined set of requirements, and turn it into fully functional software or web apps (nowadays). 

It has been nearly twelve years since I have been programming. 

### _DO(s)_
Reach out to me for project offers, job offers or to chat about anything.

### _DON'T(s)_
Please don't ask me to do algorithm test. That's not cool.
