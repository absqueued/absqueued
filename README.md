# Shekhar
I am a JavaScript Developer, a Software Developer with UX aware mindset, and a tech entrepreneur.

My skillset can qualify me (depending on how you describe a role) as a Fullstack Developer, a Frontend Developer, an Engineering Manager, or a Tech Lead.

In summary, I can take a concept, be it just an idea or a predefined set of requirements, and turn it into fully functional software or web apps.
It has been more than twelve years since I started programming so I get stuffs done.

### _DO(s)_
Reach out to me for project offers, job offers, or to chat about anything. 


### _DON'T(s)_
Please don't ask me to do an algorithm test. That's not cool.
